# Restarone JS Application

My technical submission for the Restarone JavaScript developer role.

## Approach Description

Since the brief stated the only functionality needed was to have a sidepanel open upon clickin on each entry I focused hard-coded all the other interactables to keep it simple. I spent most of the time trying to recreate the styling shown in the original images sent. 

The first step I did was deciding on which frameworks I wanted to use. I ended up deciding on using the Bootstrap to quickly create the sidepanel and badges as well as SCSS as preferred it over css.

I then started templating out the page and deciding where everything would go. 

Next I focused on creating the navbar and the left side-panel. This was all hard-coded as to keep it simple and functionality was not required.

Then I finished off by entering the data needed for the table and creating it. I lastly added the functionality using useState.

## Improvements

I ran out of time to fully finish so some of the table styling is off slightly. Given more time, I would go back and fix the styling.
